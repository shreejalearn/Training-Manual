# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Instructions Followed

Project N2: Grocery Delivery Application 
Note: The style should be neat by your choosing.

Task 1: Initialize your React Application 

Task 2: Add your dummy data  - 10 or 12 items will do the job:
- Each item should have:
	- id, name, price, item volume (kg, etc.)
	- images URLs (should be an array of images)

Task 3: Creating a multipage application requires routing. Setup this Routing package to your application. Create The home page, where you’ll be displaying the groceries (your dummy data).

Task 4: Add Jotai as the cart data handler. Add a button to add items to the cart.

Task 5: Add a new page to preview the cart. Add two buttons to increment and decrease each item’s number of purchases

Task 6: After Checkout display a popup “Thank you, for choosing us. Your Cart will arrive in 2 days.” Navigate to the Home page
